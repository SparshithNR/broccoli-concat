Simple Sourcemap-compatible Broccoli Concatenator
-------------------------------------------------

"Simple" because it does straight line-to-line translation, with no
fancy symbol mapping. This is fast and still provides useful
resolution.


It discovers input sourcemaps in relative URLs.

It doesn't yet handle input sourcemaps that are inline.
